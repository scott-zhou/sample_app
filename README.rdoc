Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://railstutorial-china.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

Create for study how to play with Ruby on Rails.
Everything is follow the course.
So nothing interesting in the code. Don't waist time to read that. :)
